    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Purpose: To transcribe voice to text and grammatically/orthographically correct the text the user selects/writes.</li>
      <li>Legal Basis: Explicit in-app consent (affirmative action) before any access.</li>
      <li>Data Processed: Selected/entered text; audio snippets when the user uses the voice feature.</li>
      <li>Processing: Encrypted in transit; exclusively used for correction/transcription; no advertising or profiling.</li>
      <li>Retention: We do not permanently store processed content; it is discarded after the response is completed.</li>
      <li>User Control: You can withdraw consent and disable the accessibility permission at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Text: The text the user selects/writes in apps with text fields (e.g., Google Keep, YouTube, SMS, Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.), when explicitly interacting with our bubbles or dialogs.</li>
      <li>Audio: Audio snippets that the user voluntarily records for voice transcription.</li>
      <li>Minimum technical metadata for service operation (e.g., response times, anonymized error logs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How and Why We Use Data</h2>
    <p>The use of data is exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To generate the voice-to-text transcription requested by the user.</li>
        <li>To produce an orthographic and grammatical correction of the text indicated by the user.</li>
        <li>To display bubbles or dialogs over other applications to collect the text/voice and return the result in the same field, speeding up the process.</li>
        <li>We do not engage in interest-based advertising, user profiling, or sell your data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Do We Request the Accessibility Permission?</h2>
    <p>The essence of <strong>AI Grammar Checker Keyboard</strong> is to offer you a fast and seamless way to correct and transcribe text directly within the apps you already use, like WhatsApp, Messenger, or your email app. To achieve this, we need the Accessibility permission for two key reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Display Floating Bubbles:</strong> The permission allows us to overlay our correction and transcription bubbles on top of other applications, so you always have them handy.</li>
      <li><strong>Read and Replace Text:</strong> When you tap one of the bubbles, the accessibility service allows us to read the text you have written at that moment and then replace it with the corrected or transcribed version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We want to be very clear: <strong>we do not use this permission for anything else</strong>. We do not log your activity, collect data from other applications, or access sensitive information like passwords or personal data. The service is only activated when you interact with our bubbles to process a specific text, preventing you from having to switch apps and manually copy and paste.</p>

    <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>We request prominent consent and affirmative action within the app before any access, as required by the Google Play User Data policy. You can withdraw your consent at any time from the app and/or by disabling the Accessibility permission in your device's Settings.</p>

    <h2>Providers and Transfers</h2>
    <p>To generate the correction/transcription, we send the text/audio in encrypted form to our processing servers and/or to third-party providers (e.g., our own proxy on Vercel/Functions and AI services like OpenAI/Whisper). We only transfer the content strictly necessary to respond to your request and do not use it for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) for all communications, logical access controls, and good security practices.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not permanently retain the processed text or audio; it is discarded upon completion of processing. We may keep anonymized error logs and technical metrics to improve stability.</p>

    <h2>Minors</h2>
    <p>The application is not intended for minors. If you are under the applicable legal age, use the app only with the supervision of your parents or guardians.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy; we will post the current version and, where appropriate, request your consent again.</p>
